# Research-Reports-IIT-Indore-
The report "A Taxonomy in Cloud Security" classifies threats (data breaches, DoS), vulnerabilities (weak authentication, misconfigurations), and solutions (encryption, IAM). It covers challenges like data sovereignty and explores future trends such as AI security, blockchain, and zero-trust to enhance cloud protection.
The research report titled "A Taxonomy in Cloud Security: Classification, Challenges, and Solutions" provides a structured analysis of security threats, vulnerabilities, and mitigation strategies in cloud computing. It categorizes various security concerns and presents solutions to enhance cloud security resilience.

Key Sections and Their Descriptions:
Abstract:

Summarizes the importance of cloud security and introduces the taxonomy approach used to classify threats and solutions.
Introduction:

Defines cloud computing and its service models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS).
Highlights the increasing reliance on cloud services and associated security concerns.
Sets the foundation for the research by emphasizing the need for a structured security framework.
Taxonomy of Cloud Security:

Categorizes security aspects into threats, vulnerabilities, and mitigation strategies.

Security Threats:

Data Breaches: Unauthorized access leading to data theft.
Denial of Service (DoS): Disrupting cloud services by overwhelming resources.
Insider Threats: Security risks posed by employees or contractors.
Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs): Long-term, targeted cyber-attacks on sensitive data.
Vulnerabilities:

Weak authentication, shared technology risks, insecure APIs, and misconfigurations.
Security Solutions:

Encryption, identity and access management (IAM), intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS), security information and event management (SIEM), and compliance auditing.
Challenges in Cloud Security:

Explores ongoing issues such as data sovereignty, zero-day exploits, lack of user awareness, and third-party dependency in cloud environments.
Future Directions and Recommendations:

Discusses AI-driven security, blockchain applications, homomorphic encryption, and zero-trust architecture as next-generation cloud security enhancements.
Conclusion:

Emphasizes the importance of a structured security taxonomy to mitigate risks in cloud environments.
Suggests adopting evolving security mechanisms to protect sensitive data and maintain compliance.
