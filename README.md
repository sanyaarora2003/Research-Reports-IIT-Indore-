The report "A Taxonomy in Cloud Security" classifies threats (data breaches, DoS), vulnerabilities (weak authentication, misconfigurations), and solutions (encryption, IAM). It covers challenges like data sovereignty and explores future trends such as AI security, blockchain, and zero-trust to enhance cloud protection.


The research report "A Taxonomy in Cloud Security: Classification, Challenges, and Solutions" presents a structured analysis of cloud security threats, vulnerabilities, and mitigation strategies.

Introduction: Highlights security risks in cloud computing and the need for a structured approach.
Taxonomy of Cloud Security: Categorizes threats (e.g., data breaches, DoS attacks, insider threats), vulnerabilities (e.g., weak authentication, misconfigurations), and security solutions (e.g., encryption, IAM, SIEM).
Challenges: Discusses issues like data sovereignty, zero-day exploits, and reliance on third-party providers.
Future Directions: Explores AI-driven security, blockchain, homomorphic encryption, and zero-trust architecture.
Conclusion: Emphasizes the need for evolving security mechanisms to protect cloud environments.
The report includes figures and tables for better understanding and references industry standards like NIST and ISO 27001.
